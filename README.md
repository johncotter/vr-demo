# vr-demo

This was a 48hr hackaton project that was created by a team of 2 designers and 2 React devs.

To explore the "show floor" double tap/click on the booth 2nd in from the top left.

Once on the show floor:
- Use "M" to return to the map view
- Use "J" to cycle through the number of attendees on the floor
- when the reticle is on the booth banner, you can use the left mouse to cycle through different images

The experience supports VR headsets (including google cardboard).
